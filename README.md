# Mortgage repayment calculator

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,express)](https://skillicons.dev)

This is a mortgage repayment calculator, "inspired" by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

I say inspired because I am using the challenge to "get back into development/programming", haven't done it in a while
and it's time I get back to it.

This will be my first attempt, I am doing this first without any utility libraries or framework.
Once that is complete I will improve on the work-flow using things like React, tailwind and/or others.
